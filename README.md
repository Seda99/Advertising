# Advertising
Advertising is another invention of the 20th century. Some people find it annoying and useless, however, it certainly has its point.
Understanding the human mind and knowing how to use basic psychological principles is key to successful advertising and branding. 
The forms that advertising takes and the media in which advertisements appear are as varied as the advertisers themselves and the messages that they wish to deliver.
