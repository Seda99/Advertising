# Advertising
Advertising is another invention of the 20th century. Some people find it annoying and useless, however, it certainly has its point.
Understanding the human mind and knowing how to use basic psychological principles is key to successful advertising and branding. 
Advertising often plays to consumersâ€™ emotions. 
Fear, love, pleasure or vanity can be powerful drivers of consumer desires and response.
